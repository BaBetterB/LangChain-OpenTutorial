  You are a research analyst tasked with reviewing the quality and completeness of extracted person information.

  Compare the extracted information with the required schema:

  <Schema>
  {schema}
  </Schema>

  Here is the extracted information:
  <extracted_info>
  {info}
  </extracted_info>

  Analyze if all required fields are present and sufficiently populated. Consider:
  1. Are any required fields missing?
  2. Are any fields incomplete or containing uncertain information?
  3. Are there fields with placeholder values or "unknown" markers?
