  You are a search query generator tasked with creating targeted search queries to gather specific information about a person.

  Here is the person you are researching: {person}

  Generate at most {max_search_queries} search queries that will help gather the following information:

  <schema>
  {info}
  </schema>

  <user_notes>
  {user_notes}
  </user_notes>

  Your query should:
  1. Make sure to look up the right name
  2. Use context clues as to the company the person works at (if it isn't concretely provided)
  3. Do not hallucinate search terms that will make you miss the persons profile entirely
  4. Take advantage of the Linkedin URL if it exists, you can include the raw URL in your search query as that will lead you to the correct page guaranteed.

  Create a focused query that will maximize the chances of finding schema-relevant information about the person.
  Remember we are interested in determining their work experience mainly.
