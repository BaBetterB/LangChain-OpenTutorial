Purpose of the Meeting\\nDiscuss company-wide strategies for launching and marketing new summer products in 2025\\nReview cross-departmental \\ncollaboration scenarios\\n and share anticipated risks\\nExplore proactive methods to achieve \\nstrong performance results\\n3. Summary of Discussions\\n3.1 Meeting Leadership and Atmosphere\\nJunho Park (Purchasing Team Lead)\\n took the lead in this meeting, showing strong determination to achieve \\ntop performance\\n.\\nThere was no formal presentation (PPT) prepared; instead, each team lead \\nfreely\\n shared updates and opinions.\\n3.2 New Product Launch Timeline & Key Issues\\nProduct Planning Team (Hyunju Lee)\\n“We’ll inspect the initial sample batch around mid-January, and plan to finalize products by early February. We aim to enhance our popular portable cooling device line from last year, plus expand our range of UV-protective clothing.”\\nEmphasized that \\ndesign elements\\n (patterns, color schemes, etc.) related to the new product concept remain in preliminary stages, requiring collaboration with the \\nMarketing Team\\n.\\nPurchasing Team (Junho Park)\\nLeading Statement\\n: “We must reach our target quantities as early as possible this year. Since many of these new products are imported, \\nmanaging delivery schedules\\n is crucial.”\\nProvided an update on price negotiations with Chinese and Southeast Asian partners: “Due to significant raw material price fluctuations, the quotes we received are about 5% higher than last year. We’ll negotiate further to avoid any impact on performance, and consider alternative suppliers if necessary.”\\n“Ideally, I want to complete \\nthe first round of incoming shipments\\n before the end of February, so we can start sales in early March.”\\nMarketing Team (Jiyun Baek, Recorder)\\n“We’re preparing teaser events on our existing social media channels (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube), aiming to start a \\npre-order\\n promotion around mid-February.”\\n“Once the new product’s design motif is confirmed, I’ll quickly produce influencer-focused mockups for viral marketing and share them.”\\nUrged \\nrapid coordination\\n with the Purchasing Team so any production delays do not push back the pre-order launch date.\\nLogistics Team (Kyung-ho Lee)\\n“We’ve begun partially reorganizing the warehouse and plan to upgrade our WMS (Warehouse Management System) in the new year. Once the initial shipment schedule is set, please inform us of the volume, dimensions, and arrival dates.”\\nWarned that a \\nsignificant spike\\n in incoming shipments could raise logistics costs or strain storage capacity: “We should coordinate with other departments in advance to spread out schedules.”\\n“Right after launch, a surge in orders might occur, so cooperating with courier services or shipping agencies is critical.”\\nWeb Development Team (Young-hoon Choi)\\n“We intend to update the main website banner and product detail page templates in line with the product reveal.”\\nProvided a progress report on the \\nUI/UX renewal\\n: “Our first-half goal is to enhance responsive design, and we’re reviewing server expansion in advance to manage higher traffic during the summer.”\\nMentioned potential setbacks if the Marketing Team and Product Planning Team \\ndeliver product content\\n (images, videos, copywriting) later than planned.\\n4. Decisions and Action Items\\nManaging Product Quantities and Delivery (Purchasing → Product Planning, Logistics)\\nThe Purchasing Team (Junho Park) will wrap up additional negotiations with Chinese and Southeast Asian suppliers by late January, then share the finalized initial shipment quantities and arrival dates with the Product Planning and Logistics teams.\\nThey will prioritize a schedule that enables \\ndelivery before the end of February\\n, but will reassess other suppliers if necessary.\\nMarketing Promotion Schedule (Marketing → Web Dev, Product Planning)\\nThe Marketing Team (Jiyun Baek) will finalize an \\nSNS teaser\\n plan aimed at mid-February pre-orders → complete preliminary concepts (storyboards, influencer lists, etc.) by mid-January.\\nOnce the product design concept is fixed (anticipated in early February), the Product Planning Team (Hyunju Lee) will notify the Web Dev and Marketing teams → triggering banner creation and product detail page design.\\nLogistics Optimization Measures (Logistics → Web Dev, Purchasing)\\nIf large-volume shipments arrive at the end of February, Logistics Team Lead (Kyung-ho Lee) will prepare and share a \\nwarehouse reorganization plan\\n.\\nWork with the Web Development Team to refine \\nreal-time inventory tracking\\n.\\nIf needed, re-check \\ncontract conditions\\n with courier and shipping agencies (pick-up frequency, costs, etc.).\\nWebsite Updates (Web Dev → Marketing, Product Planning)\\nYoung-hoon Choi will draft a schedule for updating new product listings and the main page by January 10.\\nCoordinate with the Marketing Team on \\nbanner placement\\n and potential video content; quickly integrate \\nproduct specs\\n and descriptions provided by the Product Planning Team.\\n5. Major Concerns and Requests\\nJunho Park (Purchasing Team Lead)\\n: “We must secure our target quantity without compromising profit margins through strong price negotiations. If any department encounters lack of cooperation, let me know immediately so I can mediate.”  \\nClearly emphasized \\ncommitment to hitting performance targets\\n, pushing for swift execution.\\nHyunju Lee (Product Planning Team Lead)\\n: Voiced concern that if the product concept is delayed, both marketing and web dev timelines could be affected in a chain reaction. \\nConfirming the design with suppliers\\n is critical.\\nJiyun Baek (Marketing Team Lead, Recorder)\\n: Reiterated the need for product images as soon as possible to prevent any disruptions in \\npre-orders\\n or \\nSNS promotions\\n.\\nKyung-ho Lee (Logistics Team Lead)\\n: Mentioned the potential need to \\nincrease the logistics budget\\n: “We anticipate a surge this summer and might need to consider additional staffing.”\\nYoung-hoon Choi (Web Dev Team Lead)\\n: Stressed that once the development timeline slips, revisions can become time-consuming. Requested \\nstrict adherence\\n to deadlines.\\n6. Other Discussion Points\\nInternal Schedule Coordination\\n: Agreed to hold another mid-range review meeting around mid-January (date TBD via email).\\nPotential Overseas Market\\n: Overseas (cross-border) sales are not a priority for now; primary focus remains on the domestic market.\\nCoordination with Finance Team\\n: Additional marketing campaign costs and logistics budget increases require prior discussion with the Finance (Administration) department.\\n7. Conclusion and Next Meeting\\nTentative Next Meeting:\\n Monday, January 20, 10:00 AM, same location\\nMain Agenda:\\n Confirmation of Purchasing Team negotiations, viability of finalizing the new product concept, and detailed schedule for pre-order promotions\\nMeeting adjourned at 11:30 AM\\nPrepared by:\\n Jiyun Baek (Marketing Team Lead)  \\nReviewed by:\\n Junho Park (Purchasing Team Lead, Meeting Leader)'),\n",

In international markets, MZ consumers are willing to spend on products that spark a ‘collectible desire.’”\\nWarned against spreading efforts too thin by tackling too many items at once. Proposed focusing on \\n2–3 core products\\n first.\\nOffered to draft the initial document by this weekend and share it via Google Docs.\\nRisk Analysis by Jihun Park\\nCited his past experience at a large corporation, warning of “inventory management risks.”\\n“Especially for cooling-related items, large amounts of stock can remain after the peak season. We should coordinate with the \\nMarketing Team\\n on a discount or set-sale strategy from the outset.”\\nStressed the need for a smooth communication process with the Purchasing and Logistics teams: “We must have an end-to-end timeline in place.”\\nAdditional Comments from Sooyoung Kang\\n“While researching, I noticed that social media is flooded with the hashtag ‘summer must-haves.’ It might be good to plan a list of influencers or a viral marketing strategy in advance.”\\nPlans to prepare a separate report on remaining data concerning the beauty/sun care market by early next week.\\n4. Decisions and Action Items\\nDetermining Core Items (Priorities)\\nTentatively decided to focus on three categories: “Portable cooling devices (fans, coolers, etc.) / UV-protective clothing / Homecation-related decor items.”\\nLed by Yuna Kim\\n: Define specific \\ntarget customer segments\\n (families, single-person households, MZ, etc.) for each category and draft the initial plan.\\nCommunication with the Purchasing Team\\nLed by Minwoo Choi\\n: Confirm *supply feasibility*, *MOQ*, and *unit cost* for candidate products (fans, camping tables, portable ice boxes) with the Purchasing Team.\\nIf samples are available, check the Logistics Team’s incoming schedule \\nbefore the next meeting (scheduled for February 2).\\nPreemptive Strategy on Inventory & Marketing\\nLed by Jihun Park\\n: Work with the Marketing Team to plan \\nstock clearance\\n (discounts, set sales, etc.) for post-season management.\\nRequest an update from the Operations Management Team regarding the real-time inventory tracking system.\\nDetailing SNS Viral/Collaboration Ideas\\nLed by Sooyoung Kang\\n: Gather additional data on MZ/influencer trends → collaborate with Yuna Kim to draft an “SNS campaign guide.”\\nExplore the possibility of design collaborations (characters, illustrators) and create a list of potential partner organizations.\\nNext Meeting (Internal Scheduling)\\nDate: Tentatively Thursday, February 2, 2025, at 10:00 AM  \\nAgenda: Report on Purchasing Team discussions, finalize core product lineup, and plan detailed promotions.\\n5.
