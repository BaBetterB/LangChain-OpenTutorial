    "# A Long-Term Memory Agent\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial explains how to implement an agent with long-term memory capabilities using LangGraph. The agent can store, retrieve, and use memories to enhance its interactions with users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by Research\n",
    "The concept of long-term memory in agents is inspired by papers like MemGPT and is based on our own work. The agent extracts memories from chat interactions and stores them in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Representation\n",
    "In this tutorial, \"memory\" is represented in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text Information: A piece of text generated by the agent.\n",
    "- Structured Information: Knowledge about entities extracted by the agent, represented as (subject, predicate, object) knowledge triples.   \n",
    "This structured memory can be read or queried semantically to provide personalized context during interactions with users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Idea: Shared Memory Across Conversations   \n",
    "The KEY idea is that by saving memories, the agent persists information about users that is SHARED across multiple conversations (threads), which is different from memory of a single conversation that is already enabled by LangGraph's [persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/).\n",
    "\n",
    "By using long-term memory, the agent can provide more personalized and context-aware responses across different conversations.\n",
