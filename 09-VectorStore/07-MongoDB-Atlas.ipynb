I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.\"  \"One only understands the things that one tames,\" said the fox. \"Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me . . .\"  \"What must I do, to tame you?\" asked the little prince.  \"You must be very patient,\" replied the fox. \"First you will sit down at a little distance from me--like that--in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . .\"  The next day the little prince came back.  \"It would have been better to come back at the same hour,\" said the fox. \"If, for example, you come at four o\\'clock in the afternoon, then at three o\\'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o\\'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am!

There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards.

And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad.

And he went back to meet the fox.  \"Goodbye,\" he said.  \"Goodbye,\" said the fox. \"And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\"  \"What is essential is invisible to the eye,\" the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.  \"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\"  \"It is the time I have wasted for my rose--\" said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.  \"Men have forgotten this truth,\" said the fox. \"But you must not forget it.

The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.  \"I am thirsty for this water,\" said the little prince. \"Give me some of it to drink . . .\"  And I understood what he had been looking for.  I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.  \"The men where you live,\" said the little prince, \"raise five thousand roses in the same garden--and they do not find in it what they are looking for.\"  \"They do not find it,\" I replied.  \"And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.\"  \"Yes, that is true,\" I said.  And the little prince added:  \"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart . . .\"   I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief?  \"You must keep your promise,\" said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.  \"What promise?\"  \"You know--a muzzle for my sheep . . . I am responsible for this flower . . .\"  I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:  \"Your baobabs--they look a little like cabbages.\"  \"Oh!\"  I had been so proud of my baobabs!  \"Your fox--his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long.\"  And he laughed again.  \"You are not fair, little prince,\" I said. \"I don\\'t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.\"  '),\n",

So, he tended the flower.  \\n So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity--which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:  \"Let the tigers come with their claws!\"  \"There are no tigers on my planet,\" the little prince objected. \"And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds.\"  \"I am not a weed,\" the flower replied, sweetly.  \"Please excuse me . . .\"  \"I am not at all afraid of tigers,\" she went on, \"but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn\\'t have a screen for me?\"  \"A horror of drafts--that is bad luck, for a plant,\" remarked the little prince, and added to himself, \"This flower is a very complex creature . . .\"  \"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from--\"  But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naïve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.  \"The screen?\"  \"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me . . .\"  Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same.

I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.\"  \"One only understands the things that one tames,\" said the fox. \"Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me . . .\"  \"What must I do, to tame you?\" asked the little prince.  \"You must be very patient,\" replied the fox. \"First you will sit down at a little distance from me--like that--in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . .\"  The next day the little prince came back.  \"It would have been better to come back at the same hour,\" said the fox. \"If, for example, you come at four o\\'clock in the afternoon, then at three o\\'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o\\'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am!

One must observe the proper rites . . .\"  \"What is a rite?\" asked the little prince.  \"Those also are actions too often neglected,\" said the fox. \"They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.\"   So the little prince tamed the fox.

Are there chickens?\"  \"No.\"  \"Nothing is perfect,\" sighed the fox.  But he came back to his idea.  \"My life is very monotonous,\" the fox said. \"I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you.

To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you--the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing.

But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart . . .  \"Yes,\" I said to the little prince. \"The house, the stars, the desert--what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!\"  \"I am glad,\" he said, \"that you agree with my fox.\"  As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: \"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible . . .\"  As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: \"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . .\" And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .  And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.            '),\n",
