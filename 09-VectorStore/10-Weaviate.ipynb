    "## What is Weaviate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate is a powerful open-source vector database that revolutionizes how we store and search data. It combines traditional database capabilities with advanced machine learning features, allowing you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaviate is an open source [vector database](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database).\n",
    "- Weaviate allows you to store and retrieve data objects based on their semantic properties by indexing them with [vectors](./concepts/vector-index.md).\n",
    "- Weaviate can be used stand-alone (aka _bring your vectors_) or with a variety of [modules](./modules/index.md) that can do the vectorization for you and extend the core capabilities.\n",
    "- Weaviate has a [GraphQL-API](./api/graphql/index.md) to access your data easily.\n",
    "- Weaviate is fast (check our [open source benchmarks](./benchmarks/index.md)).\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Key Feature**: Weaviate achieves millisecond-level query performance, making it suitable for production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Weaviate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate stands out for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Versatility**: Supports multiple media types (text, images, etc.)\n",
    "2. **Advanced Features**:\n",
    "   - Semantic Search\n",
    "   - Question-Answer Extraction\n",
    "   - Classification\n",
    "   - Custom ML Model Integration\n",
    "3. **Production-Ready**: Built in Go for high performance and scalability\n",
    "4. **Developer-Friendly**: Multiple access methods through GraphQL, REST, and various client libraries\n"

    "- For custom distance metrics: Utilize the `VectorDistances` class\n",
    "- For alternative vectorization: Leverage the `Configure.Vectorizer` class\n",

    "### Add Items to Vector Store\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate provides flexible methods for adding documents to your vector store. This section explores two efficient approaches: standard insertion and parallel batch processing, each optimized for different use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Insertion\n",
    "Best for smaller datasets or when processing order is important:\n",
    "- Sequential document processing\n",
    "- Automatic UUID generation\n",
    "- Built-in duplicate handling\n",
    "- Real-time progress tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parallel Batch Processing\n",
    "Optimized for large-scale document ingestion:\n",
    "- Multi-threaded processing\n",
    "- Configurable batch sizes\n",
    "- Concurrent execution\n",
    "- Enhanced throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration Options:**\n",
    "- `batch_size`: Control memory usage and processing chunks\n",
    "- `max_workers`: Adjust concurrent processing threads\n",
    "- `unique_key`: Define document identification field\n",
    "- `show_progress`: Monitor ingestion progress\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Tips:**\n",
    "- For datasets < 1000 documents: Use standard insertion\n",
    "- For datasets > 1000 documents: Consider parallel processing\n",
    "- Monitor memory usage when increasing batch size\n",
    "- Adjust worker count based on available CPU cores\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Best Practice:** Choose your ingestion method based on dataset size and system resources. Start with conservative batch sizes and gradually optimize based on performance metrics."
